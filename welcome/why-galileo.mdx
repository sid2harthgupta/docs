## Why is building AI agents hard?

Agents can hallucinate. When presented with the same task multiple times, they can yield wildly different results.

## How does Galileo help?

Galileo helps you to observe what your agent is doing, measure its performance and proactively improve the performance
of the agent. Our flagship Protect offering also provides a low latency way to prevent bad outcomes from happening.
